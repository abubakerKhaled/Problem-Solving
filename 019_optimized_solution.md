# Optimized Solution

To solve the "Max Number of K-Sum Pairs" problem more effectively, we can improve the time complexity using a **hash map** (dictionary in Python) instead of sorting and using two pointers. This approach allows us to count the frequency of elements and look for complements in a single pass, reducing the complexity from **O(n log n)** (due to sorting) to **O(n)**.

## Optimized Approach Using Hash Map

### Key Idea

- Use a hash map (`count`) to keep track of the frequency of each number in `nums`.
- As we iterate through the list, for each number `num`, check if its complement `(k - num)` exists in the hash map:
  - If it exists, we've found a pair, so we decrement the count for the complement.
  - Otherwise, increment the count for the current number `num` in the hash map.
- Continue this process until we've checked all numbers.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize a hash map (`count`) to store frequencies of elements.
2. Initialize a counter (`operations`) to track the number of valid pairs.
3. For each element in the list:
   - Compute its complement as `complement = k - num`.
   - If the complement exists in the hash map with a count greater than 0:
     - We can form a valid pair, so decrement the count for the complement and increment `operations`.
   - If the complement does not exist, increment the count for `num`.
4. Return the total number of operations.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
        count = {}
        operations = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            complement = k - num
            if count.get(complement, 0) > 0:
                operations += 1
                count[complement] -= 1  # Use the complement
            else:
                count[num] = count.get(num, 0) + 1  # Store the num in the map
                
        return operations
```

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:  
  The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `nums` list. This is because we only need to iterate through the list once, and dictionary operations (insertion and lookup) take constant time on average.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  The space complexity is **O(n)** as well, since we store the frequencies of the elements in a dictionary.

## Example

Consider the same input as before:

```python
nums = [1, 3, 3, 3, 4]
k = 6
```

The hash map approach will work as follows:

1. Start with an empty map: `{}`.
2. For the first number `1`, its complement is `5`, which isn't in the map, so add `1` to the map: `{1: 1}`.
3. For the second number `3`, its complement is `3`. The complement doesn't exist yet, so add `3` to the map: `{1: 1, 3: 1}`.
4. For the third number `3`, its complement is `3`, which now exists in the map with count `1`. Thus, form a pair `(3, 3)`, decrement the count for `3`, and increase the operation count. The map becomes `{1: 1, 3: 0}`.
5. For the fourth number `3`, its complement is again `3`, but there are no `3`s left in the map, so add `3` back to the map: `{1: 1, 3: 1}`.
6. For the fifth number `4`, its complement is `2`, which is not in the map, so add `4` to the map: `{1: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}`.

Only one valid pair `(3, 3)` was found, so the result is `1`.

## Conclusion

By using a hash map, we avoid the overhead of sorting and improve the time complexity of the solution. This approach handles large inputs more efficiently while maintaining simplicity in implementation.
