# Optimized solution

Your solution is functional, but it can be optimized and simplified slightly for readability. Here's an improved version with some suggestions:

1. **Early Exit**: You can directly return `True` if `s` is empty at the start (no need to check the length again within the loop).
2. **Simplified Logic**: There's no need to increment `t_pointer` separately when the characters don't match; you can increment `t_pointer` at the end of each loop iteration.
3. **Final Check**: Instead of an additional `if` block at the end, you can return `True` after the loop if `s_pointer` reaches the end of `s`.

Hereâ€™s the refactored version:

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if not s:
            return True

        s_pointer, t_pointer = 0, 0

        while t_pointer < len(t):
            if s[s_pointer] == t[t_pointer]:
                s_pointer += 1
                if s_pointer == len(s):
                    return True
            t_pointer += 1

        return s_pointer == len(s)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = "abc"
    t = "ahbgdc"
    sol = Solution()
    print(sol.isSubsequence(s, t))
```

## Key Improvements

- **Readability**: Simplified code logic.
- **Efficiency**: By removing unnecessary checks and handling the loop more elegantly.
