# Code Explanation

The code is designed to move all the zeroes in the list `nums` to the end while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements. The algorithm works by creating a temporary array `ele` to store the values from `nums` and then manipulates `nums` in place to achieve the desired result.

## Step-by-step Explanation

1. **Initialization:**

   ```python
   size = len(nums)
   if size < 1 or 0 not in nums:
       return
   ```

   - The `size` of the input list `nums` is calculated.
   - If the list is empty or doesn't contain any zeros, the function returns immediately since no operations are needed.

2. **Creating an auxiliary array:**

   ```python
   ele = [0] * size
   ```

   - `ele` is initialized as a list of zeros with the same length as `nums`. This will serve as a temporary buffer to store values from `nums`.

3. **First Loop - Moving Elements:**

   ```python
   first = 0
   last = size - 1
   idx = size - 1
   while first < size:
       ele[idx] = nums[idx]
       if nums[first] == 0:
           nums[last] = 0
           last -= 1
       first += 1
       idx -= 1
   ```

   - Two pointers, `first` (starting from the beginning of the list) and `last` (starting from the end), are used to traverse the list.
   - If the element at `first` is zero, the zero is moved to the back of `nums`.
   - The loop also fills the temporary list `ele` with the original values from `nums` in reverse order.

4. **Second Loop - Overwriting Non-zero Values:**

   ```python
   first = 0
   for i in range(len(ele)):
       if ele[i] != 0:
           nums[first] = ele[i]
           first += 1
   ```

   - The second loop iterates through the temporary list `ele`, and for every non-zero value, it overwrites the values in `nums` starting from the beginning.

5. **Clean Up:**

   ```python
   del ele
   ```

   - The temporary list `ele` is deleted to free up memory.

### Code Issues and Improvements

1. **Unnecessary Auxiliary Array:**
   The use of `ele` to store values is unnecessary since the problem asks to modify `nums` in-place. Using extra space isn't efficient in this context, as we can achieve the same result with a two-pointer approach without additional memory.

2. **Inefficient Reassignments:**
   The second loop involves copying non-zero elements from `ele` back to `nums`, which increases the time complexity unnecessarily.

3. **Simplified Two-pointer Approach:**
   You can solve this problem with a more efficient approach by using two pointers to directly manipulate `nums` in-place, without needing to create and manage an auxiliary array.

### Optimized Code

Hereâ€™s a more efficient and cleaner version of your code:

```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: list[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # Pointer for the position to place the next non-zero element
        non_zero_pos = 0
        
        # First pass: move all non-zero elements to the front
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != 0:
                nums[non_zero_pos] = nums[i]
                non_zero_pos += 1
        
        # Second pass: fill the remaining positions with zeros
        for i in range(non_zero_pos, len(nums)):
            nums[i] = 0
```

### Optimized Code Explanation

1. **First Pass - Moving Non-zero Elements:**

   ```python
   non_zero_pos = 0
   for i in range(len(nums)):
       if nums[i] != 0:
           nums[non_zero_pos] = nums[i]
           non_zero_pos += 1
   ```

   - This loop moves all non-zero elements to the front of `nums`. The `non_zero_pos` pointer keeps track of where the next non-zero element should be placed.
   - The elements are moved in-place, meaning no extra memory is required.

2. **Second Pass - Filling with Zeros:**

   ```python
   for i in range(non_zero_pos, len(nums)):
       nums[i] = 0
   ```

   - After all the non-zero elements have been shifted to the front, this loop fills the rest of the list with zeros.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The optimized code runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the list, because we iterate through the list twice: once to move non-zero elements and once to fill zeros.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) because we do not use any additional lists or arrays.

By using this optimized two-pointer approach, the code is more efficient and easier to understand.
